My name is Alex Ayers, and I keep getting promoted out of being a developer, so writing code in my free time is the only reliable way
I'll be able to continue my hobby. My dream is build a game that I can spend years working on, but so far I've mostly had a lot of false starts, but I'm
stubborn, so I've not given up on this dream.
